<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Write a class called Point without using ECMAScript 6, which represents a point in two-dimensional space. A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.

It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum of the two points, that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties.
</p>
<p>Class definition in the file app/assets/javascripts/point.js</p>
<p>Point1 = (1,2)</p>
<p>Point2 = (1,3)</p>
<b>Result is: </b> <span id="result"></span>
<script type="application/javascript">
  console.log("Part one plus points")
  var point1 = new Point(1,2)
  var point2 = new Point(1,3)
  var result = point1.plus(point2)
  console.log(result)
  document.querySelector("#result").innerHTML = "(" + result.x + "," + result.y +")"
